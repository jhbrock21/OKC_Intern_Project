    "The purpose of this project is to gauge your technical skills and problem solving ability by working through something similar to a real NBA data science project. You will work your way through this jupyter notebook, answering questions as you go along. Please begin by adding your name to the top markdown chunk in this document. When you're finished with the document, come back and type your answers into the answer key at the top. Please leave all your work below and have your answers where indicated below as well. Please note that we will be reviewing your code so make it clear, concise and avoid long printouts. Feel free to add in as many new code chunks as you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we will be grading the quality of your code and visuals alongside the correctness of your answers. Please try to use packages like pandas/numpy and matplotlib/seaborn as much as possible (instead of base python data manipulations and explicit loops.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** Your project will **ONLY** be graded if it's knit to an HTML document where we can see your code. Be careful to make sure that any long lines of code appropriately visibly wrap around visibly to the next line, as code that's cut off from the side of the document cannot be graded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Throughout this document, any `season` column represents the year each season started. For example, the 2015-16 season will be in the dataset as 2015. For most of the rest of the project, we will refer to a season by just this number (e.g. 2015) instead of the full text (e.g. 2015-16).** "

    "\n",
    "You're going to work to create a dataset with a \"career outcome\" for each player, representing the highest level of success that the player achieved for **at least two** seasons *after his first four seasons in the league* (examples to follow below!). To do this, you'll start with single season level outcomes. On a single season level, the outcomes are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Elite: A player is \"Elite\" in a season if he won any All NBA award (1st, 2nd, or 3rd team), MVP, or DPOY in that season.    \n",
    "- All-Star: A player is \"All-Star\" in a season if he was selected to be an All-Star that season.   \n",
    "- Starter:  A player is a \"Starter\" in a season if he started in at least 41 games in the season OR if he played at least 2000 minutes in the season.    \n",
    "- Rotation:  A player is a \"Rotation\" player in a season if he played at least 1000 minutes in the season.   \n",
    "- Roster:  A player is a \"Roster\" player in a season if he played at least 1 minute for an NBA team but did not meet any of the above criteria.     \n",
    "- Out of the League: A player is \"Out of the League\" if he is not in the NBA in that season.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make an adjustment for determining Starter/Rotation qualifications for a few seasons that didn't have 82 games per team. Assume that there were 66 possible games in the 2011 lockout season and 72 possible games in each of the 2019 and 2020 seasons that were shortened due to covid. Specifically, if a player played 900 minutes in 2011, he **would** meet the rotation criteria because his final minutes would be considered to be 900 * (82/66) = 1118. Please use this math for both minutes and games started, so a player who started 38 games in 2019 or 2020 would be considered to have started 38 * (82/72) = 43 games, and thus would qualify for starting 41. Any answers should be calculated assuming you round the multiplied values to the nearest whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on a season level, a player's outcome is the highest level of success he qualifies for in that season. Thus, since Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was both All-NBA 1st team and an All-Star last year, he would be considered to be \"Elite\" for the 2022 season, but would still qualify for a career outcome of All-Star if in the rest of his career he made one more All-Star game but no more All-NBA teams. Note this is a hypothetical, and Shai has not yet played enough to have a career outcome.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Rotation (3), Roster (4), Roster (5), Out of the League (6+) would be considered \"Out of the League,\" because after his first four seasons, he only has a single Roster year, which does not qualify him for any success outcome.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), All-Star (7), Elite (8), Starter (9) would be considered \"All-Star,\" because he had at least two seasons after his first four at all-star level of production or higher.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), Rotation (7), Rotation (8), Roster (9) would be considered a \"Starter\" because he has two seasons after his first four at a starter level of production. \n"

    "### Open Ended Modeling Question   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will work to build a model to predict a player's career outcome based on information up through the first four years of his career. \n",
    "\n",
    "This question is intentionally left fairly open ended, but here are some notes and specifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We know modeling questions can take a long time, and that qualified candidates will have different levels of experience with \"formal\" modeling. Don't be discouraged. It's not our intention to make you spend excessive time here. If you get your model to a good spot but think you could do better by spending a lot more time, you can just write a bit about your ideas for future improvement and leave it there. Further, we're more interested in your thought process and critical thinking than we are in specific modeling techniques. Using smart features is more important than using fancy mathematical machinery, and a successful candidate could use a simple regression approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. You may use any data provided in this project, but please do not bring in any external sources of data. Note that while most of the data provided goes back to 2007, All NBA and All Rookie team voting is only included back to 2011.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A player needs to complete three additional seasons after their first four to be considered as having a distinct career outcome for our dataset. Because the dataset in this project ends in 2021, this means that a player would need to have had the chance to play in the '21, '20, and '19 seasons after his first four years, and thus his first four years would have been '18, '17, '16, and '15. **For this reason, limit your training data to players who were drafted in or before the 2015 season.** Karl-Anthony Towns was the #1 pick in that season.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once you build your model, predict on all players who were drafted in 2018-2021 (They have between 1 and 4 seasons of data available and have not yet started accumulating seasons that inform their career outcome).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can predict a single career outcome for each player, but it's better if you can predict the probability that each player falls into each outcome bucket.    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Include, as part of your answer:  \n",
    "  - A brief written overview of how your model works, targeted towards a decision maker in the front office without a strong statistical background. \n",
    "  - What you view as the strengths and weaknesses of your model.  \n",
    "  - How you'd address the weaknesses if you had more time and or more data.  \n",
    "  - A matplotlib or plotly visualization highlighting some part of your modeling process, the model itself, or your results.  \n",
    "  - Your predictions for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Zion Williamson, James Wiseman, and Josh Giddey.  \n",
    "  - (Bonus!) An html table (for example, see the package `reactable`) containing all predictions for the players drafted in 2019-2021.  \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "My model is designed to predict the career outcomes of NBA players based on their performance during the first four years of their careers. The goal is to provide front office decision-makers with insights into whether a player is likely to have a successful career or not. The model takes into account various player statistics, including games played, minutes, points per game, and other performance metrics. It uses logistic regression, a common statistical technique, to make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "-Interpretability: The model's simplicity allows for easy interpretation of the results. Decision-makers can understand which factors are most influential in predicting a player's career outcome.\n",
    "-Real-world Applicability: Logistic regression is a practical choice for this problem since it can handle small datasets and works well with binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "-Limited Data: The model relies on data up to the 2015 draft class, which limits its ability to predict players drafted in 2018-2021. More recent data could provide valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Assumptions: The model assumes that a player's early career performance is a strong indicator of their entire career. While this can be true in many cases, some players may experience significant changes in performance later in their careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Weaknesses:\n",
    "To address the weaknesses, I would consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-More Recent Data: Collecting and incorporating data for players drafted after 2015 would improve the model's ability to predict more recent draft classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Feature Engineering: Identifying additional relevant features or developing more sophisticated features could enhance the model's predictive power. For example, incorporating advanced player tracking data and player-specific trends could be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Advanced Models: Exploring more complex machine learning models beyond logistic regression, such as decision trees or neural networks, could potentially capture intricate patterns in player careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictions for Specific Players:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: Starter\n",
    "2. Zion Williamson: Starter\n",
    "3. James Wiseman: Starter\n",

    "Using the `rebounding_data` dataset, we'll predict a team's next game's offensive rebounding percent to be their average offensive rebounding percent in all prior games. On a single game level, offensive rebounding percent is the number of offensive rebounds divided by their number offensive rebound \"chances\" (essentially the team's missed shots). On a multi-game sample, it should be the total number of offensive rebounds divided by the total number of offensive rebound chances.    \n",

    "What I would do to better account for missing players would be to take each players rebounds per game and find the percentage of the teams total rebounds they accounted for. I would do this for every game available at the point in time that you need the information, then I would average each players percent of total team rebounds out and adjust the future games prediction by the percent the missing player accounts for. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say Chet Holmgren accounts for an average of 20% of the teams rebounds per game through 46 games and Jaylin Williams accounts for 5% of the teams total rebounds through 46 games. If Holmgren is missing, I would lower the predicted offensive rebound percentage by up to 15% because of the difference in total percent contribution to the teams rebounds between the two players. I say up to 15% because there is always a chance that Jaylin Williams will increase his share of the teams rebounds with more playing time, in fact, it is very probable this will happen. So reducing the total rebound percent by maybe 5-10% and adjust the percentage on a game to game basis. "

    "1. Lack of Seasonal Variation Handling\n",
    "The original model assumes that the offensive rebound percentage remains constant throughout the season. We all know that as a season progresses, players and teams can get worn down and start to under-perform in some areas. To account for this, I would implement either a rolling average or a moving window approach. Instead of considering the average for all previous games, you would only calculate the average for the most recent games in order to give more weight to recent performances and capture changes in team dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Player Injuries and Lineup Changes\n",
    "The original model does not account for injuries, trades or lineup changes. These can have a huge affect on rebounding percentage in the short term or on a game to game basis. To account for this issue, I would try to incorporate data on player availability and lineup changes. For example, some teams like to implement a strategy called 'small ball.' This means that a team would sacrifice height and power for speed and agility because it would create a mismatch between the guard-type players and the post players. The effect of this would be increased scoring but also decreased rebounding due to the sacrifice in height and power. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Opponent Strength Variation\n",
    "The model doesn't account for the differences between each team, it essentially treats everyone equally. To account for this, I would incorporate opponent-specific stats. This would help in identifying how the oppenent's capabilities compare to our own capabilities. We could even compare our stats versus a team we have already played to the stats of the opponent who has also played that team. This would give some insight as to whether we were able to perform better against a team we have both played."
